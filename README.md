# Seletected Theme: Advanced Algorithms in Practice
The project of Team 75, Fine-tuning pretrained scGPT for bioinformatics service in the biotech industry, is a collaboration between Old Dominion University and Admera Health LLC (https://www.admerahealth.com/) 

We aim to finetune scGPT (https://github.com/bowang-lab/scGPT) to cell type identifing using the single cell RNAseq data. 
The long-term goal is to integrate this capability into the bioinformatics pipeline of Admera Health. 

Our project aligns with theme "Advanced Algorithms in Practice: Bring cutting-edge AI methodologies like reinforcement learning, active learning, or foundation models into real-world applications."
